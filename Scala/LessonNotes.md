# Scala

* Scala is a hybrid langauge - Supports both OO and Functional Programming
* Scala runs on the JVM
* Scala can use Java libraries directly
* Scala is statically typed
* Synatax similar to Java
* Immutable variables: Scala forces you to make a decision whether a variable is mutable


## Characteristics of a functional language

* Made up of functions that always return a value
* Funtional programs avoid changing state or mutating data, once its set you leave the value alone.
* Scala, allows for flexibility of these characteristics
* Scala does not force you to eliminate mutable state but it gives you the tools to do things in a functional state


## Types

* Everything in Scala is an Object! (some small exceptions)
* Strings are first class citizens
* Scala is a strongly typed language, it will give you a compiler error if you try to do something like this: ```"abc" * 4```
