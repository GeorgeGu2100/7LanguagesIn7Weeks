# Prolog

* Is a logic programming language

## Building Blocks

* Facts: is a basic assertion about some world
* Rules: an interface about the facts in that world
* Query: is a question about that world

* Facts and Rules go into a knwoledge base

## Facts

* Capitalization matters
* If a word begins with a lowercase letter it is an atom (similar to a symbol in Ruby)
* If it begins with a Capital letter or underscore then its a variable
* Variable values can change, atoms cannot!
